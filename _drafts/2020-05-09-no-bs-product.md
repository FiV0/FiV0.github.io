When I was living in Paris I bought a belt. The place I went to only made belts, maybe some other
minor leather products, but mainly just belts. I explained to the women that was serving me that I would
like to buy a belt that would last for a lifetime. She said that I could definitely buy one there
and then told me the following little story which I find quite telling. She said that most
customers come twice in their lifetime. Their first come to just buy a belt which will
and later in life when *ils ont pris un peu du poid* they come a second time to get a larger belt.

Let's go through two more examples of products which I consider following a no bs approach.

## Rohloff

Rohloff AG is a german manufacturer of a bike gear hub. They produce exactly one gear hub
, *The Rohloff Speedhub 500/14*, the only gearhub with 14 gears. With less than 120 grams per
gear this is world leader. Apart from the engineering miracle, rohloff hubs are well
known for their durability and robustness. People use them for decades before the need of
an oil change. The hub is of course also not cheap compared to other things on the market.
They have produced this same hub since 1995.


I hope it is somehow clearer what I mean by a no bs product. A product which might be expensive
but you know what you are buying.

I am wondering why we have so little products that follow this philosophy.
Build something really rebust or where parts are exchangable.

I often have the impression that it's technology possible to build nearly everything the no bs way.
The quesiton is why it's done so little.

timelessness

So the question I would like to address in this post is what makes some products more adapted to
a no bs approach and others.

Is there a no bs software or saas product?
