I have been working at [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com) for about 2 and half months. It's a computational platform
for collaborative research. Check it out, it's pretty awesome! As I want to use the platform more often as a user,
I decided to blog over there for the time being. The platform is actually really great for blogging about technical/programming related content.
You can run your code and if somebody wants to play with the code, one can easily remix (kind of the equivalent of forking)
the post. You can find my posts at [https://nextjournal.com/fivo](https://nextjournal.com/fivo).
I started a little series called *A clj snippet* where I discuss some clojure code snippets. An attempt to fullfill the promised
52 blogposts for the year.
