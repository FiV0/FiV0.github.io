Hi ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Finn VÃ¶lkel, a software engineer based in Berlin.
I work at [Juxt](https://juxt.pro/) and most of the time on [XTDB](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb).
My current interests are mostly around databases and distributed systems.

This space is where I share insights, ideas, and occasionally some reflections on areas I find intriguing.

You can reach me at `firstname.lastname@gmail.com` (forget the umlaut).
