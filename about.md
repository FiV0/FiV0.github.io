title: About

My name is Finn VÃ¶lkel and I am software engineer currently living in Berlin.
I work at [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/) building stuff in Clojure.
This blog is mainly about algorithms, graph theory and programming.
I use it to ramble about things I am interested in or want to share some thoughts on.

You can reach me at `firstname.lastname@gmail.com` (forget the umlaut).
