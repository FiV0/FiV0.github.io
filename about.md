My name is Finn VÃ¶lkel and software engineer currently living in Berlin pursuing some personal projects.
This blog is mainly about algorithms, graph theory and programming. I use it to ramble about things I am interested in or want to share some thoughts on.

You can reach me at `firstname.lastname@gmail.com` (forget the umlaut).
