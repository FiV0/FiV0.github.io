I am PhD student in the [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/) laboratory at [Paris 7](http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/sc/site.php?bc=accueil&np=accueil).
This blog is mainly about algorithms, graph thoery and programming. I use it to ramble about things I am interested in or feel to share some
thoughts on.

Before becoming a PhD student I did my undergraduate in Computer Science at [Lyon 1](http://www.univ-lyon1.fr/) with
a year abroad in [Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). Afterwards I did the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) (Computer Science Research Master) at Paris 7.
